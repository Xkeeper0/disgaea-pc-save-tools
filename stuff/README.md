This is currently a work-in-progress warehouse of various things.

This documentation will probably not be up to date.

* `dungeon.dat.php` : Parses the Disgaea PC "dungeon.dat" file. Not terribly useful.
* `script.dat.php` : Dumps all the scripts from the `../data/` folder into `scripts/` folder. Filenames are the script IDs.
* `parsescript.php <file>` : Reads script from `<file>` and attempts to parse it.
* `_parseall.php` : Reads all script files in `scripts/` and outputs their parsed results to `scripts/p/`

Recombobulating these files is not yet supported.
